# Intro

I am a versatile professional with expertise in web development, digital marketing, brand management, and procurement. With proficiency in full-stack development, particularly the MERN stack, I have led teams to deliver impactful projects like marketplace apps and referral websites. My background also includes content strategy and driving brand growth through effective digital marketing. Additionally, my leadership in community outreach through Harvest International Ministry reflects my passion for innovation, problem-solving, and creating value across various sectors.

# Some History

- In 2020, I graduated with First Class honors in Business Administration from the University of Professional Studies, Accra. I didn’t just study—I also took on leadership roles as Treasurer, Secretary, and Youth Leader, keeping myself as busy as a juggling act.. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.
- From 2020 to 2022, I worked at the Youth Employment Agency, managing tenders, supplier databases, and purchasing orders. Let’s just say I became a master at procurement, turning negotiations into an art form.
- In early 2024, I dove headfirst into web development at Mest Africa. I led a team of developers, and we rolled out an agro marketplace, a movie streaming platform, and—because every dev needs one—a shiny portfolio site.
- While I was at it, I joined CoreXtreme in April 2024 to develop a ridesharing progressive web app. You know, just casually building complex apps because why not?
- By June 2024, I became a Frontend Developer at AshToken, creating a referral website to track payments and generate codes for token purchases. React and the MERN stack quickly became my best friends.
- From November 2022 to February 2024, I moonlighted as a digital marketer at Earth LLC, where I whipped up content strategies and kept my eye on engagement metrics like a hawk.
- Somewhere in between, in early 2023, I also managed branding and operations at Artfrica Studios, because apparently, I thought juggling two careers wasn’t enough excitement.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
