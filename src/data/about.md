# Intro

I am the co-founder and CTO of [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev), where we're building open-source tools to evaluate, find, and fix vulnerabilities in LLMs. Before Promptfoo, I was the VP of Engineering at [SmileID](https://www.usesmileid.com), where I led the development of tools that have helped over 170 million people in Africa gain access to financial services. I also co-founded [Arthena](https://arthena.com) and [Matroid](https://matroid.com).

In my spare time, I enjoy investing in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz), focusing on projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch.

# Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.
- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand-new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.
- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.
- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it, and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.
- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.
- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
